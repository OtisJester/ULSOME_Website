Hello, world! 🌍

This is the first post on my new personal website. I've built this site to serve as a central hub for my game development projects, technical experiments, and thoughts on the industry.

## The Tech Stack

I decided to move away from a traditional CMS and build something lightweight and performant.

- **Framework**: Next.js (App Router)
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages
- **Content**: Markdown

## Why "Digital Garden"?

I treat this space not just as a blog, but as a garden. Some ideas will start as seeds (short notes), grow into saplings (tutorials), and eventually become full trees (comprehensive project post-mortems).

Stay tuned for more updates on **Congress Simulator** and **Project: NEXUS**!
